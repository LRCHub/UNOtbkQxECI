Not a king not a queen, bullshit
Not caught up in between, bullshit
Not a man in a dress, not a damsel in distress
Waiting for you to save me, oh shit
What you get, what you see, bullshit
Wanna see, wanna be, bullshit
Nothing here for you to see, k shit?
All the T's to the back all my people to the front

Don't fret, don't fret, don't fret, don't fret

Keep talking if you want to get your throat slight
Throw the first punch I want you to try it
Come at me bitch I want you to try it

Its so nice to see all my friends vibing
Fantasizing about the ocean rising
So we're devising planning the uprising
Analyzing, equalizing, organizing, maximizing

Bet you won't answer the call
Writing is all the wall
Nothing's forever
No single endeavor will ever come out of the squall

I'm sorry baby? Is there something wrong?
Well don't fret sucker it won't be wrong for long

Don't fret
